This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on their profile and transaction history. It uses a Random Forest Classifier for accurate and interpretable predictions and is deployed as a Streamlit web app for interactive use.

**🔍Project Overview**
